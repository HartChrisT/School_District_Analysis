## Overview of the School District Analysis
Purpose: To aggregate the standardized test and school budget data and showcase trends in school performance to assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. Also to address concerns by the school board of academic dishonesty by taking out potentially fradulent test scores and re-running the analysis to see to what extent, if any, the data was altered.

## Summary

The small 0.2% decline in the district's overall passing rate is largely explained by relatively small amount of grades affected by academic dishonesty. The overall passing rate of Thomas High School dropped by 0.3%, however, they are still the second-best performing school in the district. Omitting the 9th grade reading and math scores had a very small effect on the performance of Thomas High School as a whole, mainly because those scores were within a couple tenths of a percent of the other scores. Schools by spending remained the same, the more you spend per student on average, the worse they perform, Charter schools did overwhelmingly better than District schools, and small schools did much better than bigger schools.
